## Themes of Research within Discipline
* Synthesizing explanations
* Tutorial mining

## Summary of Research
* Core arguments
    * The various information needs of programmers ∈ N
    * N_E ⊆ N are better satisfied by explanations and examples than code
    * Empirically-evaluated mapping n ↦ t, where n ∈ N_E, t ∈ T (natural language and example generation techniques)
    * The mode M of satisfying n ∈ N impacts design and mental models
    * Mapping of m ↦ d ∈ D, c ∈ C, from mode of learning to design and conceptual outcomes for CS students
    * Mapping d ↦ u ∈ U, c ↦ u ∈ U, of intended design and concept outcomes to a set of user interaction principles for online web pages
* Methods
    * Observation of novice and intermediate programmer behavior
    * Empirical studies of novice and intermediate programmer behavior
    * Task-centered design of user interaction
